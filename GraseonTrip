Grason:What now
Trip:Car’s not starting
Grason: And we’re in the middle of nowhere…
Trip: Yeah, its ok, no big deal. Hang on we’ll try to…
Grason: Of course this is a big deal. You shouldn’t have taken that last turn. I told you keep on the highway. You always want to take a short cut, you always want to get there faster.
Trip: You told me? You mean you tried to yell it down my ear while I was trying to listen to music?
Grason: That’s the problem, you don’t listen to me. So I have to yell sometimes
Trip: When you yell its hard to listen to you
Grason: what should I do, what should I do instead…
Trip: Maybe if you were calm and actually spoke without so much aggression. Maybe if you were calm…
Grason: Don’t tell me to be calm, you know it’s the one. thing…I cannot stand it when someone tells me to be calm
Trip: Or for fucks sake be aggressive, be a fucking dick, we’re in the middle of nowhere and here you are being a jerk.
Grason: I don’t have cellphone service, what are we going to do? I don’t know how to fix an engine, do you?
Trip: Oh so you can be aggressive, you have no problems shouting down my fucking ear, you have no problems abusing and insulting me, but when it comes to changing a tyre or having a look at the engine you cant do that. What kind of a man are you.
Grason: What kind of a man are you, you can’t do these things either.
